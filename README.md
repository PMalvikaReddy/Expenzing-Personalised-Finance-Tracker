# Expenzing- Personalised Finance Tracker
## Introduction :

Effective finance management and keeping track of your expenses is an important part of managing oneâ€™s overall finances. Many people struggle to keep track of their personal   or business finances, which can lead to overspending, missed payments, and financial stress. Traditional methods of tracking expenses, such as using spreadsheets or paper receipts, can be time-consuming and prone to errors.   

## Solution :

An expense tracker web application can address this problem by providing a user-friendly platform for tracking income and expenses in real-time. By using an expense tracker web application, individuals can easily monitor their financial transactions, analyse their spending habits, make informed financial decisions, avoiding unnecessary expenses and ultimately achieve their financial goals.  

The project is a personalized expense tracker web application that would help the user track and categorize their income and expenses. The web application would also offer educational tools like    blogs to help the user learn more about budgeting and money. These financial blogs can be a valuable resource for individuals who want to learn how to track their expenses effectively. It would provide users with expert advice, budgeting tips, real-world examples, etc.   

## Methodology :
The mini project is being implemented using ReactJs which is a open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces.   
React uses a component-based architecture. It allows developers to create reusable UI components that can be easily combined to build complex user interfaces. This makes it easier to manage and maintain large codebases, as well as to update and modify the user interface without having to change the underlying code.

The project uses React hooks that provide a way to reuse stateful logic across components, and they can make functional components more powerful and easier to understand.  These include useState(), useEffect(), useContext().
